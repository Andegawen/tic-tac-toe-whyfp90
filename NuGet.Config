<!-- This file is duplicated and identical between the root of the
     repository for local builds and the root nuget folder for TeamCity
     builds. In TeamCity we checkout the copy in the nuget folder to the
     root. This is necessary as TC doesn't allow per-file check-outs and
     we don't want to checkout the entire repository for every build
